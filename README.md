   - Each thread has its own Claude session and context

3. **Chat with Claude** 🤖
   - All Claude operations happen in your selected project directory
   - Files created by Claude are saved in your project folder

### 🎯 Navigation

- **Action Buttons** - Use the interactive buttons to navigate
- **Chat Commands**:
  - `/back` - Return to thread selection
  - `/files` - View project file structure  
  - `/help` - Show help information

### 📁 Project Structure

```
your-project/
├── <files generated by Claude>
├── <folders created by Claude>
└── .threads/
    ├── threads.json      # Project metadata
    ├── thread-1.json     # Thread session data
    └── thread-2.json     # Another thread
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Components

- **Frontend**: Chainlit web interface with action-based navigation
- **Backend**: Flask REST API with job queue for async processing  
- **Integration**: Claude CLI with full session management
- **Storage**: JSON files for metadata (no database required)

### File Organization

```

## 🔧 Development

### Manual Startup

If you prefer to run components separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Flask API
python app.py

# Terminal 2: Start Chainlit Frontend  
chainlit run chainlit_app.py

# Terminal 3: Test API (optional)
python test_api.py
```

### API Endpoints

The Flask backend provides these key endpoints:

- `GET /projects` - List all projects
- `POST /project/new` - Create new project
- `GET /project/{name}/threads` - List project threads
- `POST /project/{name}/thread/new` - Create new thread
- `POST /project/{name}/thread/{id}/message` - Send message to Claude
- `GET /status/{job_id}` - Check job status
- `DELETE /project/{name}` - Delete project
- `DELETE /project/{name}/thread/{id}` - Delete thread

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `PORT` - Flask API port (default: 5000)
- `DEBUG` - Enable debug mode (default: False)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Claude API key (handled by Claude CLI)

### Chainlit Configuration

Edit `.chainlit/config.toml` to customize the web interface:

```toml
[UI]
name = "Claude Web Runner"
description = "Web interface for Claude Code"
default_collapse_content = true
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "API Connection Failed"**
- Make sure Flask backend is running on port 5000
- Check that `data/projects` directory exists

**❌ "Claude CLI not found"**
- Install Claude CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Authenticate: `claude auth`

**❌ Frontend won't load**
- Check Python version (3.8+ required)
- Verify Chainlit installation: `pip install chainlit`
- Try refreshing the browser

### Getting Help

- Check the `/help` command in the web interface
- Review `README_CHAINLIT.md` for detailed frontend docs
- Look at `Documentation/` folder for technical details
